# Software_Architecture_Project
This is an open-ended project that was developed over the course of about half of a semester in my Software Architecture Class. It is a simple alarm clock in which 
an alarm can be created, turned on/off, select to turn a Snooze mode on/off, how many seconds a snooze button event click lasts, and the "sound" an alarm creates
(no sound is emmited from the computer, the pop-up indicating the alarm went off states the sound). Previous alarms set are seralized in a text file that loads the 
alarms back into the system for reuse when the program is turned off then back on.

To access the executable for running the program, download and extract the latest release (located in the "Releases" section on the righthanded side of the main repo page) "Source code.zip" folder, go to the ...\501_P2\bin\Release file and click on the 501_P2.exe to run.
